# LVGridCapacity
The original code describes a model to generate low-voltage grid proxies to assess residential end-use technologies. The model relies on open and public data, and include operationalization of standards and rules governing low-voltage grids as of 2020. The model use input on population density, dwelling distribution, annual highresolution (10 min) load profiles and solar production profiles. The input data is not included in the modelling package due to copyrights.

A full description of the model can be found in the corresponding MethodsX paper:
A full description of the dataset can be found in the corresponding Data in Brief paper:
An analysis of the model results concerning residential solar photovoltaic in Sweden, Germany and UK can be found in the corresponding Renewable Energy paper: 

Here small modifications were done to match the needs of the P2P communities.

Great thanks to the authors of the original model for their help.
