# Overview
University of Geneva's Energy Efficiency Group's P2P solar communities with PV and batteries provides a python model for simulation of P2P local markets. The framework combines distributed energy resource modelling (e.g. for PV generation sources and battery energy storage systems), prosumer trading preferences, and energy market modelling, for one year.

The methods used are presented in detail in the following publication:

A. Pena-Bello, D. Parra, M. Herberz, V. Tiefenbeck, M. Patel and U.J.J. Hahnel; "Integrating prosumer trading preferences into the design of peer-to-peer energy communities"; Nature Energy, 2022
